Readme file for TExT Old Testament Hebrew Lexicon 
December 16, 2010

The vision of this project is to create a collaboratively produced modern replacement for Strongs' OT Greek Dictionary that can be distributed and translated freely.

The files were prepared in the following manner: 
- The base for the source file was an XML file of Strong's lexicon from the CrossWire website (http://crosswire.org/~chrislit/osis/texts/strongs.tei.zip). Strong's is in the public domain.
- This file was converted to MDF standard format markers. It includes some custom markers. 
- Strong's numbers, lexemes, transliterations (with conversion to SBL transliteration begun), glosses, and links to other Strong's terms were retained. However, as much as possible the extraneous text of Strong's was trimmed down. 
- A Perl script was written to convert the mdf markers into TEI for import into the SWORD Library.
